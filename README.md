## Introduction

Zonemaster is a software package that validates the quality of a DNS delegation. The ambition of the Zonemaster project is to develop and maintain an open source DNS validation tool, offering improved performance over existing tools and providing extensive documentation which could be re-used by similar projects in the future.

Zonemaster consists of several modules or components. The components will help different types of users to check domain servers for configuration errors and generate a report that will assist in fixing the errors.

## Background

DNSCheck from IIS and Zonecheck from AFNIC are two old software packages that validate the quality of a DNS delegation. AFNIC and IIS came together to develop a new DNS validation tool from scratch under the name Zonemaster. Zonemaster intends to be a major rewrite of Zonecheck and DNSCheck, and aims to implement the best parts of both.

## Purpose

The components developed as part of the Zonemaster project will help different
types of [users](USING.md) to check domain servers for configuration errors and
generate a report that will assist in fixing the errors.

The ambition of the Zonemaster project is to develop and maintain an open source
DNS validation tool, offering improved performance over existing tools and
providing extensive documentation which could be re-used by similar projects in
the future.

## Documentation

This is the main project repository. In this
repository, documentation regarding the [design](docs/design),
[requirements](docs/requirements) and [specifications](docs/specifications)
for the Zonemaster implementation are available. 
We also have a brief [user guide](USING.md).

architecture listed below.

### Supported processor architectures

* en.UTF-8
* fr.UTF-8
* sv.UTF-8
* da.UTF-8 (*)

*) Some strings have not yet been translated to Danish.

## Zonemaster and its components

The Zonemaster product consists of the main part and five components. The main part
consists of specifications and documentation for the Zonemaster product, and is
stored in main Zonemaster Github repository ([zonemaster]).

All the software for the Zonemaster project belong to the five components, each
component being stored in its own Github repository (listed below).

The software has not yet been packaged for any operating systems, and you have to 
install most of it from the source code. The recommended method is to install 
from [CPAN], but it is possible to install directly from clones of the Github 
repositories.

The Zonemaster Product includes the following components:

 * [zonemaster-ldns] - A fork of [ldns] with a Perl frontend used by [zonemaster-engine].
 * [zonemaster-engine] - The Zonemaster test library.
 * [zonemaster-cli] - A Command Line Interface (CLI) to the test library.
 * [zonemaster-backend] - A JSON/RPC interface with database to the test library.
 * [zonemaster-gui] - A web user interface to the test library via [zonemaster-backend].

## Installation

To install Zonemaster, start with installation of [zonemaster-engine] (which will
draw in Zonemaster-LDNS) and then continue with the other parts. You will find 
installation instructions from the links above.

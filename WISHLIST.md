WishList for Version 2.0
=========================

1. Multiple points of checking - Should be able to run tests from different end points and get the results and fusion together into one result
2. Able to conduct tests for a batch of domains
3. IDN support
4. Verifying the server is not an open resolver
5. Alert if the domain does not use DNSSEC
6. Alert if no NS is available in IPv4
7. Alert if no NS is available in IPv6
8. Structured output of the result and/or a library to run the tool
from another program (the library may be useful even if the tool has a
structured output).
9. Test suite, as a deliberately broken set of DNS zones, like DNSSEC
people did <http://www.dnssec-tools.org/testzone/>.
10. Developing a Mobile app
11. Parallel tests
12. It would be nice to test if unknown RR types can be queried (Ref :
https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?36909)

The objective of this document is to group in all feedback with respect to
the test specifications.<br/>
When there are multiple authors for the same test case,number them. For
example, if there are two comments for the same test case by different
authors, number the comments as 1. and 2., and in the author column add your
three letter acronym  for example such as 1: PWA and 2: SBA <br/>

| Test   | Category change | Discard | Review/comments                  | Author   |
|:-------|:---------|:--------|:----------------------------------------|:---------|
| [Delegation06](Delegation-TP/delegation06.md) | No | No | 1. 05 & 06 only relevant if it is actually a glue record? [Review not clear to the gate keeper (SBA)]| Marc |
| [Address01](Address-TP/address01.md) | No | No |R03 makes no sense to me. Is this "the address of the nameserver is not in a private network", or "the addresses served in A records are not in private network spaces", or ...?| Hoffman |
| [DNSSEC07](DNSSEC-TP/dnssec07.md) | No | No |If there exists DNSKEY at child, the parent should have a DS |Hoffman|
| [Nameserver03](Nameserver-TP/nameserver03.md) | No | No |Lack of clarity in the table would make it hard for someone to understand the overall structure|Hoffman|

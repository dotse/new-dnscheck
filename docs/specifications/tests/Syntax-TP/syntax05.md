## SYNTAX05: Misuse of '@' character in the SOA RNAME field

### Test case identifier
**SYNTAX05** There must be no misused '@' character in the SOA RNAME field

### Objective

The SOA RNAME field does not allow the '@' characters to be used for
describing a mailbox. The first dot ('.') is thus translated into the
'@' character. This is a common mistake. The rules are defined in
[RFC 1035](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt).

### Inputs

The domain name to be tested.

### Ordered description of steps to be taken to execute the test case

1. Obtain a set of name server IP addresses using [Method4] and [Method5].
2. Create a SOA query for the zone.
3. Send the SOA query over UDP to each name server IP address until a
   response is received or until the set is exhausted.
4. Check if the RNAME field contains a '@' character.


### Outcome(s)

If there is any '@' character in any SOA/RNAME field, this test case fails.

### Special procedural requirements

None.

### Intercase dependencies

The de-escaped output from this test is used by [SYNTAX08](syntax08.md).

## SYNTAX06: No illegal characters in the SOA RNAME field

### Test case identifier
**SYNTAX06** There must be no illegal characters in the SOA RNAME field

### Objective

The SOA RNAME field is a mailbox address. The SOA RNAME field is defined
in section 3.3 of [RFC 1034](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1034.txt) and
section 2.2 of [RFC 1912](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1912.txt). The RNAME
field should follow the rules of an e-mail address also defined in section
3.4.1 of [RFC 2822](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#section-3.4).

### Inputs

The domain name to be tested.

### Ordered description of steps to be taken to execute the test case

1. Obtain a set of name server IP addresses using [Method4] and [Method5].
2. Create a SOA query for the zone.
3. Send the SOA query over UDP to each name server IP address until a
   response is received or until the set is exhausted.
4. Get the RNAME from the SOA record.
5. Convert the first non-escaped "." to an "@" in the RNAME.
6. De-escape the RNAME, converting a "\." to ".".
7. Verify the result from step 3 and 4 according to the Addr-spec
   specification in RFC 2822 section 3.4.1. If this verification fails,
   this test case failes.


### Outcome(s)

If there is any SOA/RNAME field that is invalid according to RFC 2822,
this test case fails.

### Special procedural requirements

None.

### Intercase dependencies

None.

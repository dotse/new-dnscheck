# DELEGATION02: Name servers must have distinct IP addresses

## Test case identifier

**DELEGATION02:** Name servers must have distinct IP addresses

## Objective

If the domain's name servers use several different names, they can all
be using the same IP address. This may be due to a configuration error, or
a workaround for a certain policy restriction. This test case checks that
the name servers used do not reuse the same IP addresses.

Section 4.1 of [RFC 1034] says at least two name servers must be used 
for a delegation.

## Inputs

"Child Zone" - The domain name to be tested.

## Ordered description of steps to be taken to execute the test case

1. Obtain the complete set of name server names in the delegation of
   the *Child Zone* using [Method2] and the IP addresses for each name 
   using [Method4].

2. If the same IP address is found for two or more name server names, 
   emit *[DEL_NS_SAME_IP]* for each repeated address, else emit
   *[DEL_DISTINCT_NS_IP]*.

3. Obtain the complete set of name server names from the *Child Zone* 
   using [Method3] and the IP addresses for each name using [Method5].

4. If the same IP address is found for two or more name server names, 
   emit *[CHILD_NS_SAME_IP]* for each repeated address, else emit
   *[CHILD_DISTINCT_NS_IP]*.

## Outcome(s)

The outcome of this Test Case is "fail" if there is at least one message
with the severity level *ERROR* or *CRITICAL*.

The outcome of this Test Case is "warning" if there is at least one message
with the severity level *WARNING*, but no message with severity level
*ERROR* or *CRITICAL*.

In other cases the outcome of this Test Case is "pass".

Message               | Default severity level (if message is emitted)
:---------------------|:-----------------------------------
DEL_NS_SAME_IP        | ERROR
CHILD_NS_SAME_IP      | ERROR
DEL_DISTINCT_NS_IP    | INFO
CHILD_DISTINCT_NS_IP  | INFO

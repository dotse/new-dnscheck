# DNSSEC16: Validate CDS

## Test case identifier
**DNSSEC16**

## Objective

CDS and CDNSKEY record types are defined in [RFC 7344] and [RFC 8078].
Both record types are optional in a zone. The objective of this test
case is to verify that the CDS RRset is valid. This test case is
only relevant if the zone has at least one CDS record. For tests of the
CDNSKEY, see test case [DNSSEC17].

## Scope

It is assumed that *Child Zone* has been tested by [Basic04]. This test
case will just ignore non-responsive name servers or name servers not
giving a correct DNS response for an authoritative name server.

It is assumed that *Child Zone* has been tested or will be tested by 
[DNSSEC15] and [DNSSEC17] and that the servers give the same responses.
Running this test case without running [DNSSEC15] and [DNSSEC17] can
give an incomplete report of the CDS and CDNSKEY status of 
*Child Zone*.

## Inputs

* "Child Zone" - The domain name to be tested.

## Summary

* If no CDS record is found, the test case will terminate early
  with no message tag outputted.
* If a CDS record is of "delete" type, then it can by definition not
  match or point at any DNSKEY record.

## Ordered description of steps to be taken to execute the test case

1.  Create the following empty sets:
    1.  Name server IP address and associated CDS RRset and its RRSIG
        records ("CDS RRsets"). RRSIG records may be absent.
    2.  Name server IP address and associated DNSKEY RRset and its 
        RRsig records ("DNSKEY RRsets"). RRSIG records may be absent.
    3.  Name server IP address ("No DNSKEY RRset").
    4.  Name server IP address ("Mixed Delete CDS").
    5.  Name server IP address ("Delete CDS").
    6.  Name server IP address and associated CDS key tag 
        ("No Match CDS With DNSKEY").
    7.  Name server IP address and associated CDS key tag
        ("DNSKEY Not Signed By CDS").
    8.  Name server IP address ("CDS Not Signed").
    9.  Name server IP address and key tag
        ("CDS Signed By Unknown DNSKEY").
    10. Name server IP address and key tag ("CDS Invalid RRSIG").

2.  Create a CDS query with EDNS enabled and the DO bit set for the
    apex of the *Child Zone*.

3.  Create a DNSKEY query with EDNS enabled and the DO bit set for
    the apex of the *Child Zone*.

4.  Retrieve all name server IP addresses for the *Child Zone* using
    [Method4] and [Method5] ("NS IP").

5.  Repeat the following steps for each name server IP address in 
    *NS IP*:

    1. Send the CDS query over UDP to the name server IP address.
       1. If no DNS response is returned, then go to next name server
          IP.
       2. Else, if AA bit is not set in the DNS response, then go to
          next name server IP.
       3. Else, if the RCODE in the DNS response is not *NOERROR*, then
          go to next name server IP.
       4. Else, if the answer section has no CDS records, go to next
          name server IP.
       5. Add the name server IP and the CDS RRset from the answer
          section to the *CDS RRsets* set. Also include any associated
          RRSIG records in the answer section.
    2. Send the DNSKEY query over UDP to the name server IP address.
       1. If no DNS response is returned, then go to next name server
          IP.
       2. Else, if AA bit is not set in the DNS response, then go to
          next name server IP.
       3. Else, if the RCODE in the DNS response is not *NOERROR*, then
          go to next name server IP.
       4. Else, if the DNS response contains at least one DNSKEY
          record in the answer section, then add the name server IP and
          the DNSKEY RRset from the answer section to the 
          *DNSKEY RRsets* set. Also include any associated RRSIG 
          records in the answer section.
    3. Go to next name server IP.

6.  If the *CDS RRsets* set is empty then terminate this test case.

7.  For each name server IP in the *CDS RRsets* set do:

    1. If the CDS RRset is non-empty, get the RRset and its RRSIG
       records, else go to next name server IP address.
    2. If any CDS record is a "delete" CDS, then do:
       1. If there is more than a single CDS record then add the name
          server IP to the *Mixed Delete CDS* set.
       2. Else, add the name server IP address to the *Delete CDS*
          set.
       3. Go to next name server IP.
    3. Get the DNSKEY and its RRSIG records, if any, from the
       *DNSKEY RRsets* for the same name server IP.
    4. If there are no DNSKEY records, then do:
       1. Add name server IP address to the *No DNSKEY RRset* set.
       2. Go to next name server IP.
    5. Repeat the following steps for each CDS record:
       1. Compare the key tag from the CDS record with the calculated
          key tags for the DNSKEY records.
       2. If the CDS record does not match any DNSKEY record then add
          the name server IP address and CDS record key tag to the
          *No Match CDS With DNSKEY* set.
       3. Else, if there is no RRSIG for the DNSKEY RRset created by
          the DNSKEY record that the CDS record points at then add the
          name server IP address and key tag of CDS record to the
          *DNSKEY Not Signed By CDS* set.
    6. If there are no RRSIG records for the CDS RRset, then add the
       name server IP address to the *CDS Not Signed* set.
    7. Else, for each RRSIG (CDS) do:
       1. If the key tag of the RRSIG does not match any DNSKEY then
          add the name server IP address and key tag to the
          *CDS Signed By Unknown DNSKEY* set.
       2. Else, if the RRSIG cannot be validated by the DNSKEY it
          refers to by key tag, then add the name server IP and RRSIG
          key tag to the *CDS Invalid RRSIG* set.
    8. Go to next name server IP address.

8.  If the *No DNSKEY RRset* set is non-empty, then output
    *[DS16_CDS_WITHOUT_DNSKEY]* with all name server IP addresses
    in the set.

9.  If the *Mixed Delete CDS* set is
    non-empty, then output *[DS16_MIXED_DELETE_CDS]* with all
    name server IP addresses in the set.

10. If the *Delete CDS* set is non-empty, then output
    *[DS16_DELETE_CDS]* with all name server IP addresses.

11. If the *No Match CDS With DNSKEY* set is non-empty then do:
    * For each CDS key tag in the set do:
        * Output *[DS16_CDS_MATCHES_NO_DNSKEY]* with the CDS key tag
          and the name server IP addresses in the set for that key
          tag.

12. If the *DNSKEY Not Signed By CDS* set is non-empty then do:
    * For each CDS key tag in the set do:
        * Output *[DS16_DNSKEY_NOT_SIGNED_BY_CDS]* with the CDS key
          tag and the name server IP addresses in the set for that
          key tag.

13. If the *CDS Invalid RRSIG* set is non-empty then do:
    * For each RRSIG key tag in the set do:
        * Output *[DS16_CDS_INVALID_RRSIG]* with the RRSIG key tag and
          the name server IP addresses in the set for that key tag.

14. If the *CDS Not Signed* set is non-empty then output 
    *[DS16_CDS_UNSIGNED]* with all name server IP addresses in the set.

15. If the *CDS Signed By Unknown DNSKEY* set is non-empty then output
    *[DS16_CDS_SIGNED_BY_UNKNOWN_DNSKEY]* with the name server IP
    addresses in the set.


## Outcome(s)

The outcome of this Test Case is "fail" if there is at least one message

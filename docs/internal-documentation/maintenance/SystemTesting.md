System testing
==============
Before a new version of Zonemaster can be released it must pass three levels of
system testing: Installation Testing, Smoke Testing and Acceptance Testing.
Each test level is described in a separate section below. A separate section is
reserved for the concept of Configurations, which is used by other sections.


## 1. Configurations

The purpose of configurations is to provide different contexts for the tests to
run in.

A configuration is a tuple of the following parameters:

* architecture (e.g. x86_64)
* operating system version (e.g. Ubuntu 14.04)
* database engine version (e.g. PostgreSQL 9.3)
* system locale (e.g. en_US.UTF-8)

Each parameter has a section below definig the parameters more closely.

The set of possible values for each configuration parameter is declared in the
README.md of the top-level zonemaster repository.

Each test level section specifies a subset of all possible configuration tuple
to test.


### Architecture

The only architecture we support is amd64/x86_64.


### Operating system version

The following operating systems are supported:

* Centos
* Debian
* FreeBSD
* Ubuntu

For each supported operating system, the supported versions are determined using
the following criteria.

* CentOS:
  * The supported versions are the Base Distributions (excluding 5 and 6) as
    specified at: 
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CentOS#End-of-support_schedule
  * The supported minor release is the one specified at:
    https://wiki.centos.org/Download

* Debian:
  * The supported versions are "stable" and "oldstable" as specified at: 
    https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases#Current_Releases.2FRepositories
  * The supported point release is the current one as specified at:
    https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases/PointReleases

* FreeBSD:
  * The supported versions are the Extended releases (excluding 9.3) as
    specified at: https://www.freebsd.org/security/
  * Patch level should not be specified.

* Ubuntu:
  * The supported versions are the LTS releases (excluding 12.04) as specified
    at: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases
  * The supported patch level is the one specified at:
    https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases


### Database engine version

The following database engines are supported:

* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* SQLite

... To be specified. It's slightly complicated.


### System locale

Zonemaster promises to behave correctly when the system locale is set to one of
these locales.

... Do we support all possible locales in this sense? Since we cannot reasonably
perform testing for all possible locales, supported system locales are grouped
into a small set of "tier 1" system locales to be used in test configurations,
and the remaining "tier 2" system locales.


## 2. Installation testing

This test level validates that all components of Zonemaster can be installed
according to their respective installation instructions.


### Configurations

This test level gives at least full coverage for each individual parameter.


### Procedure

For each configuration:

1. Prepare a machine
   1. Allocate a machine with the architecture specified by the configuration.
   2. Install the OS as specified by the configuration on the machine.

2. Install Zonemaster Engine
   1. Follow the installation instruction at zonemaster-engine/docs/installation.md
      to the letter.
   2. Perform a sanity check.

      ```
      time perl -MZonemaster -e 'print scalar Zonemaster->test_zone("zonemaster.net"), "\n"'
      ```

      The command is expected to take very roughly 15 seconds and print a number
      greater than one.

3. Install Zonemaster Backend
   1. Follow the installation instruction at zonemaster-backend/docs/installation.md
      to the letter.
   2. Perform a sanity check. 

      ```
      curl -s -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"version_info","id":"1"}' http://localhost:5000/ && echo
      ```

      The command is expected to give an immediate JSON response.

4. Install Zonemaster GUI
   1. Follow the installation instruction at zonemaster-gui/docs/installation.md
      to the letter.
   2. Perform a sanity check. Point your browser to this URL:

      ```
      http://localhost/
      ```

      You should be presented with a page showing, among other things the
      Zonemaster logotype.

5. Install Zonemaster CLI
   1. Follow the installation instruction at zonemaster-cli/docs/installation.md
      to the letter.
   2. Perform a sanity check.

      ```
      zonemaster-cli --version
      ```

      The command is expected to list various version number information.


## 3. Smoke testing

This test level validates that fundamental use cases:

* work independent of specific configurations
* weren't broken by new changes


### Configurations

... To be specified.


### Procedure

For each configuration:

1. Prepare an installation

2. Smoke test of Zonemaster CLI

   ... Test a number of basic/important use cases.

3. Smoke test of Zonemaster GUI

   ... Test a number of basic/important use cases.


## 4. Acceptance testing

This test level validates that new changes:

* work independent of specific configurations
* weren't broken by other new changes


### Configurations

...


### Procedure

1. Prepare an installation

2. Acceptance testing through Zonemaster CLI

   ... Test each new entry in the zonemaster-cli and zonemaster-engine components.

3. Acceptance testing through Zonemaster GUI

   ... Test each new entry in the zonemaster-gui, zonemaster-backend and zonemaster-engine components.

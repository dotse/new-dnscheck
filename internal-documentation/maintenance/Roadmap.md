# Zonemaster - Roadmap

## Scope
The current roadmap scope is for the year 2015.

## Roadmap 

"Trello" dashboard is used to create the roadmap. It is available in this link :
https://trello.com/b/Afo0A4Ib/zonemaster

The roadmap currently includes all the issues that has to be done. The issues
include bugs, features, documentation, enhancement etc.

## Readme for using the "Trello" dashboard

All the issues has been grouped under different releases (For e.g. 2015.1). Each
release has a tentative date indicated (e.g. 2015.1 (Backend)  - 05/05/2014) 

For each issue, under a respective release, the assigned user is indicated. For e.g. (SBA) indicates that
the roadmap is assigned to a project member with these initials. "?" indicates
that an user is still not assigned to the issue.

Currently, three color codes are used with each issue. "Green" to indicate that the issue has
been successfully finished. This is then validated by the "Release Manager" and
then removed from the dashboard. "Yellow", indicates work in progress and "Red"
indicates ToDo. 

For each issue, different characteristics could be assigned. For e.g. the due
date for the issue is indicated with the "timer" icon and proposed date. If the
issue has not been finished by the proposed date then it is indicated in "red".
If there are multiple sub issues, to complete the issue, then it is indicated by
a "tick" icon with the number of checklist (e.g. 0/6). Comments to an issue is indicated 
with a comment icon and the number of comments. 

To add/view efforts, for each issue, the user should open the link in chrome and
add the plugin "plus" from this link
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/plus-for-trello-time-trac/gjjpophepkbhejnglcmkdnncmaanojkf

The plugin "plus" provides facilities to add Estimated time (All time is in days),
which is indicated with a "grey" box. The time already spent on the issue is
inidated in a "rose" box. The sum of all the effort for different issues in a
release is added up and indicated at the end of the release heading.

On clicking the  "hourglass" icon (for the plugin "plus") displayed at the top right of
the borwser has other features, such as displaying a report, which if needed can
be used in the future. 



Users can be added by invite. Currently the dashboard is "public". But it can be
restricted only to members

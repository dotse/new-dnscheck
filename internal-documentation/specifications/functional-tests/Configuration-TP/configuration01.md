## CONFIGURATION01: The data for a canonical name and its aliases cannot be different

### Test case identifier

**CONFIGURATION01:** The data for a canonical name and its aliases cannot be
different

### Objective 
Section 3.6.2 of [RFC 1034](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034)
mentions that if a CNAME RR is present at a node, no other data should be
present; this ensures that the data for a canonical name and its aliases cannot
be different.  This rule also insures that a cached CNAME can be used without
checking with an authoritative server for other RR types.

The objective of this test is to verify whether the engine conforms to the
specification described above.

### Inputs

The domain to be tested.

### Ordered description of steps to be taken to execute the test case

1. Configure a live zone, wherein the CNAME record coexist with any other data

```
configuration02-z1.zft-root.rd.nic.fr.
```

2. A standard query for the domain is made 
3. If the query donâ€™t receive Error response, the test returns with FAIL

### Results
Current DNS softwares does not allow a zone to be loaded wherein a CNAME coexist
with other RR. The only way to emulate this behavior is to use an old DNS
software version or write our own implementation. It has been decided that such
efforts are not necessary at this stage and hence this test is not run.

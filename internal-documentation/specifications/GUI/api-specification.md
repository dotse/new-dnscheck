**API**
* I want to be able to list (see name of) all available test profiles (pre-defined set of tests for the engine to run).
* I want to be able to send/set these advanced runtime options:
 - No IPv4
 - No IPv6
 - Choose a test profile
* I want to get a progress report of a test being run, in X of Y tests executed or a percentage of tests run.
* I want to know what the current running test (or test level) is in every progress update.
* I want to able to send name servers (hostname and ip per ns) and DS records (algorithm and hash) along with the domain to test for undelegated-test purposes.
* I want to be able to configure priority of normal and undelegated runs (serverside).
* I want to get tests queued if too many to start all at once and started where highest priority goes first.
* I want to be able to get a list of all previous tests of the same type (normal vs undelegated) to be able to list these based on the domain name and test type (ordered by date).
* I want to be able to retrieve complete test results from old tests listed from above. 
* I want to be able to set the number of concurrent tests being run as to not overload the engine/machine/network.
* Undelegated runs should be set at a lower priority than normal runs by default.
